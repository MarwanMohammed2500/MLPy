# MLPy
This is an open source implementation of all big Machine Learning models, it's purely educational, for both me and whoever sees this

# Why did I make this?
Starting my Machine learning journy, and honestly way before that, I always believed in the power of modules and libraries, but a lot of other people i know rely purely on them without knowing what is going on under the hood or don't have that much of an understandnig of it, so i decided to create MLPy, which stands for *Machine Learning in Python*.

# Who is this for?
Anyone really.<br>
You're new to Machine learning? Welcome.<br>
You've been doing this for a while and wanna check what's going on? Hello.<br>
You're an expert and want to revise on somethings maybe? Actually if you are, that's kinda cool and i'd like to talk with you! I think we could be of use to each other since i'm still relatively new to the field.

# What algorithms will I cover?
Honestly, I'm not sure. This is a work in progress and something I do when I find time, so I'll cover what I can, and when I learn something new I'll implement it and add it here and on kaggle, but I will be covering both Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms to the extent of my expertise

# Who am I?
I'm studying to become and intelligent systems engineer, and I enjoy my field of studying and --what hopefully will be-- my field of work!

Anyways, welcome to MLPy! Feel free to hit me up for a chat via LinkedIn, Email, or whatever other mean you prefer. and I hope this helps you out :D
